# IoT-Based-Smart-Door-Lock
The door can be unlocked by using a pre-set password or by using the OTP sent to the verified person or by scanning the authorised RFID or by sending verified telegram commands or from the IoT dashboard. In case of any suspicious attempts made to unlock the door, the notification would be sent to the authorised person via SMS/Email/Telegram message. A simple user interface has been designed so that a user can easily interact with the designed system.
